# Work in Progress

Front end for the application, written in React and TypeScript, uses [shogiground](https://github.com/WandererXII/shogiground) to render the board. Currently, It functions as a simple webapp for playing shogi online. All the game logic is performed in the [backend](https://github.com/penguin-enthusiast/shogi-backend). A demo can be found [here](http://www.rtshogi.com).

The plan is to expand it into an implementation of "Real Time Shogi" where there are no turns and either player can move pieces at anytime as long as they haven't been moved recently (see [Kung-Fu Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung-Fu_Chess)).
