            For the basic rules of shogi and how pieces move, see <a href="https://lishogi.org/learn">https://lishogi.org/learn</a> or <a href="https://shogi-international.com/rules/">https://shogi-international.com/rules/</a>.
            The pieces also have an icon on them that indicate how they move if you need a reminder.

            In real time Shogi, the base game remains the same; piece movements, drops, and promotions remain unchanged.
            However, there are no turns. Each player can move any of their available piece at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a piece has been moved, it will enter a cool-down phase for a short period of time (5 seconds) and may not be moved for that duration.
            Other pieces not on cool-down can still be moved.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dropped pieces will also start with a cool-down immediately after being dropped to the board.

            Once you connect to a game, click the button that says "Click when ready".
            When both players are ready, the game will start.
